# Learning Management System (LMS) – C++ & Qt

This project is a **desktop-based Learning Management System (LMS)** developed as a **semester project** using **C++ and the Qt Framework**. The application demonstrates how a basic academic management system can be built using object-oriented programming and a graphical user interface.

The system follows a **role-based design**, providing separate functionality for **Admin, Faculty, and Students**. Each role has its own dashboard and responsibilities, ensuring organized and controlled access to academic data.

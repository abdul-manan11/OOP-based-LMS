Learning Management System (LMS) – C++ & Qt

This project is a desktop-based Learning Management System (LMS) developed as a semester project using C++ and the Qt Framework. The application is designed to demonstrate core software engineering and object-oriented programming concepts through a role-based academic management system.

The LMS provides separate access and functionality for Admin, Faculty, and Students, allowing structured interaction between different users within a simulated university environment. The system focuses on clean design, modular architecture, and GUI-based interaction.
